[00:22.54] Drove around the block, drove a lot,
[00:24.34] Lookin' all around, don't see no cops,
[00:27.01] Whispered in your ear, a ghetto star,
[00:29.75] Sittin' on my lap inside of my car,
[00:32.48] Lookin' at my lips, take a taste,
[00:34.23] Taste yours too, rub your back,
[00:36.96] Run your fingers on the logo of my baseball hat,
[00:39.65] Moonlight dancin' inside of your eyes,
[00:41.49] Close your legs, I start to sigh,
[00:44.12] Now I reach down to unlace my Nikes,
[00:46.96] Kick off your Adidas 'cause that's what you like,
[00:49.67] Chris Tucker joke passed inside of my head,
[00:52.35] Put the thought away think of you instead,
[00:54.16] Hot outside, it's hot in here,
[00:56.80] Roll down the window the breeze in your hair,
[00:59.57] Your earrings shake, you a baby doll,
[01:02.23] You say you want me but did you want them all?
[01:04.91] Make me feel special, I know that you can,
[01:06.77] Make me feel special like a prominent man,
[01:09.46] Prominent, dominant McCoy and I'm real,
[01:12.23] Another brotha's fan? Forget how he feel
