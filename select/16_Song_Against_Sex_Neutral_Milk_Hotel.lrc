[00:18.75] And the first one tore a picture
[00:21.24] Of a dead and hanging man
[00:24.00] Who was kissing foreign fishes
[00:26.86] That flew right out from his hands
[00:29.47] And when I put my arms around him
[00:32.41] Felt the blushing blood run through my cheeks
[00:35.58] And an eerieness surrounded
[00:37.95] When his tongue began to speak
[00:40.51] And he said: "Oh, boy, you are so pretty"
[00:43.63] "Enough to wrap tight in rice-paper string"
[00:46.81] And when I finally kissed him
[00:49.17] The whole world began to ring
[00:51.59] Lost like a bell that's tipping over
[00:54.79] With two cracks along both sides
[00:57.39] And I knew the world was over
[01:00.02] So I took a look outside
[01:02.73] And watched the fires that were reaching
[01:05.49] Up to the weather vanes and the tops of trees
[01:08.85] And the waiting scene and the Sunday dream
[01:11.44] They're all waiting here for me
[01:26.94] 
[01:25.30] Deli markets with their flower stands
[01:28.19] Their pretty girls and their burning men
[01:30.72] Hanging out on the hooks
[01:32.18] Next to window displays
[01:33.75] And I took out my tongue
[01:35.02] Twice removed from my face
[01:36.51] Across a bridge and across the mountains
[01:38.52] Threw a nickel in the fountain
[01:41.19] To save my soul from all these troubled times
[01:44.47] And all the drugs that I don't have the guts to take
[01:46.55] To soothe my mind so I'm always sober
[01:49.74] Always aching, always heading towards
[01:54.61] Mass suicide, occult figurines
[01:57.55] And wasted gas-station attendants
[02:00.90] Attending to their jobs
[02:03.68] And a nice drive in the country
[02:06.36] Finds a nice cliff to drop off
[02:08.79] Oh, when this life just gets so grating
[02:12.04] All the grittiness of life
[02:14.88] But don't take those pills your boyfriend gave you
[02:18.02] You're too wonderful to die
[02:31.52] 
[02:42.46] And the last one tore a picture
[02:44.96] From the pornographic page
[02:47.71] And all the pleasure points attacking
[02:50.35] All the looks of love were staged
[02:52.95] And it's a lie that you've been given
[02:56.03] That just hurts you every day
[02:59.08] So why should I lie here naked
[03:01.84] When it's just too far away
[03:03.99] From anything we could call loving
[03:07.62] Any love worth living for
[03:10.34] So I'll sleep out in the gutter
[03:12.88] You can sleep here on the floor
[03:15.45] And when I wake up in the morning
[03:18.63] I won't forget to lock the door
[03:21.03] 'Cause with a match that's mean and some gasoline
[03:24.38] You won't see me anymore
